Everything in this repository is purely for educational use.
It is simply exploratory data analysis and includes the implementations of different methods like high-pass filters or Short Time Fourier Transforms to look for anything significant in the data.

All the code written here will supplement a set of Python scripts (to be written) which will prepare and process radar data.

No practices have been implemented because the program structure itself has not been decided. Purely for visual aid and curiosity.

A well-structured program is to be written once real experimental data has been gathered.

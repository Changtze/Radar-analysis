Everything in this repository is purely for educational use.
It is simply exploratory data analysis and includes the implementations of different methods like high-pass filters or Short Time Fourier Transforms to look for anything significant in the data.

All the code written here will supplement a set of Python scripts (to be written) which will prepare and process radar data.

No best practices have been implemented because the program structure itself has not been decided.
